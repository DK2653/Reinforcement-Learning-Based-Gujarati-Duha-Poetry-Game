# Reinforcement-Learning-Based-Gujarati-Duha-Poetry-Game
The projectâ€™s goal is to create a reinforcement learning-based game using Gujarati Duha poetry. Users are shown a Duha stanza with one word missing, and they must choose the missing word from a list of choices. The game features Qlearning, which allows the agent (player) to learn from its interactions and improve its performance over time
